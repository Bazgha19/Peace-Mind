## Inspiration
Imagine a life with a disturbed mind, how's that?
As per research, a disturbed mind may emerge a tendency for baseless anger which also results in crime or suicide. A mind can be disturbed due to some problems and you don't share with anyone then this starts frustration and anger.
So on this International Peace Day, I'm introducing **Peace Mind...**

## What it does
It helps you to share your thoughts and problems without telling your name as well as it provides another section where you can share your ideas or solution to any problem.

**Share your problem:** In this section, you can share your problem or thoughts which will result in reducing your stress a little bit and peace of mind.

**Share your Ideas:** This section is for those who can solve any problem and want to share his/her idea with other people,  then here you can just write about your project and submit.
